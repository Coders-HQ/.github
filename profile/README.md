<h2>:wave: Introduction</h2>
<p>CodersHQ is a platform developed under the direction of H.H Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum with the goal of establishing advanced coding communities that will drive the growth of the UAE's digital economy. The platform, which was built by and for the community, was launched in a virtual ceremony organized by the National Programme for Coders. The ceremony was attended by H.E Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, as well as representatives from partner organizations. The initiative aims to create a new generation of coders capable of addressing future challenges and opportunities in the knowledge-based economy. It also aims to provide an incubating environment for skilled coders to innovate technical solutions to current societal challenges. 

As part of the National Programme for Coders, CodersHQ also aims to establish the UAE as a global hub for coders and a center for innovative ideas to build a better future. The platform features advanced technological infrastructure, including an events space, a supercomputer, and workspaces, with plans to inaugurate six additional locations throughout the UAE.

CodersHQ focuses on 3 main objectives:
<ol>
 <li>Assessing and developing the skills of coders in the UAE.</li>
 <li>Enabling continuous communication among coders in the UAE and around the world.</li>
 <li>Providing coders with the best opportunities to help them ideate, create and innovate.</li>
</ol>


As part of our efforts to support the growth of the UAE's digital economy, we plan to organize training programs for Emiratis to facilitate their participation in various coding fields. These programs will provide them with the best global knowledge to hone their skills. We will be collaborating with a wide range of organizations from government, semi-government, private and academic sectors to achieve our goal of promoting coding. These partners include Abu Dhabi University, Majid Al Futtaim Holding, Microsoft Middle East and Africa, IBM, Presales MERAT, Meta, Rabdan Academy, the American University in Dubai, DP World, ADNOC, VMware, and more.</p>

<h2>:technologist: CodersHQ</h2>
<p>CodersHQ manifests itself in 2 ways: <b>CodersHQ Space</b> and <b>CodersHQ Platform/Community</b>.</p>

<h3>:house: CodersHQ Space</h3>
<p>The CodersHQ Space is divided into 7 sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><ins>Main Hall</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Python Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>JavaScript Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>C Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Kitchen</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Solidity Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Supercomputer Room</ins></li>
</ul>

<p>:classical_building: The Main Hall is where we host conferences and meetups at CodersHQ. A Huawei Smartboard and a Podium are available to speakers to enhance their presenting abilities and enable Hybrid Events (wow, much tech!).</p>

<p>:snake: The Python Room is where coders come together to ideate, create and innovate. It contains a conference table with space for 6 people, and a gorgeous window wall (that makes you feel like a fish in a bowl).</p>

<p>:scroll: The JavaScript Room houses an array of state of the art Desktop Computers, capable of computing the heaviest of loads at lightning speeds (Cyberpunk 2077!?)</p>

<p>:eyes: The C Room, much like it's current state in the industry, is an empty room with tables and chairs (you should be glad we decided to include it in the first place).</p>

<p>:fork_and_knife: The Kitchen is a place to recharge with fellow coders and a bite to eat. Sadly, we don't have an Electric Kettle yet (as the formula says, recharge = rest + <del>fuel</del> fury)</p>

<p>:eyeglasses: The Solidity Room is a storage room and <b>REDACTED</b> room combined. It's where all the nerds (<b>cough</b> Rash- <b>cough</b>) hangout.</p>

<p>:muscle::desktop_computer: The Supercomputer Room is pretty self explanatory; a room with a supercomputer. This computer is able to perform every kind of workload you can imagine (too bad you don't have access to it ψ(｀∇´)ψ).</p>

<h3>:speech_balloon: CodersHQ Platform/Community</h3>
<p>The CodersHQ Platform/Community has a lot of initiatives going on at once, and it's often hard to keep track of everything that's going on. Every initiative at CodersHQ falls under 10 major categories, and this section serves as a map of everything that's currently going on at CodersHQ that you (yes, your beautiful face!) can participate in:</p>

</ul>

<p>:brain: hq(get inspired) is an initiative that attracts the biggest global tech influencers to the local coding community, with the prime objective of igniting a passion in people for coding by learning from the challenges and personal life stories of prominent people in tech.</p>

<p>:writing_hand: hq(assessment) is an initiative that focuses on assessing coders technical skills in the UAE, with the goal of connecting them to some of the best opportunities in the market.</p>

<p>:office_worker: hq(ambassador) is an initiative that recruits coders from the local coding community to "spread the coding message" by way of hosting events, building projects, networking and growing the community.</p>

<p>:loudspeaker: hq(conferences) is an initiative that takes hq(meetups) and bumps it up to a whole new level by getting a lot more people involved from a lot more diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p>
