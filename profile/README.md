<h2>:wave: Introduction</h2>
<p>CodersHQ is a platform developed under the direction of H.H Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum with the goal of establishing advanced coding communities that will drive the growth of the UAE's digital economy. The platform, which was built by and for the community, was launched in a virtual ceremony organized by the National Programme for Coders. The ceremony was attended by H.E Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, as well as representatives from partner organizations. The initiative aims to create a new generation of coders capable of addressing future challenges and opportunities in the knowledge-based economy. It also aims to provide an incubating environment for skilled coders to innovate technical solutions to current societal challenges. 

As part of the National Programme for Coders, CodersHQ also aims to establish the UAE as a global hub for coders and a center for innovative ideas to build a better future. The platform features advanced technological infrastructure, including an events space, a supercomputer, and workspaces, with plans to inaugurate six additional locations throughout the UAE.

CodersHQ focuses on 3 main objectives:
<ol>
 <li>Assessing and developing the skills of coders in the UAE.</li>
 <li>Enabling continuous communication among coders in the UAE and around the world.</li>
 <li>Providing coders with the best opportunities to help them ideate, create and innovate.</li>
</ol>


As part of our efforts to support the growth of the UAE's digital economy, we plan to organize training programs for Emiratis to facilitate their participation in various coding fields. These programs will provide them with the best global knowledge to hone their skills. We will be collaborating with a wide range of organizations from government, semi-government, private and academic sectors to achieve our goal of promoting coding. These partners include Abu Dhabi University, Majid Al Futtaim Holding, Microsoft Middle East and Africa, IBM, Presales MERAT, Meta, Rabdan Academy, the American University in Dubai, DP World, ADNOC, VMware, and more.</p>
