<p>CodersHQ is a platform created to support the growth of the UAE's digital economy by establishing advanced coding communities. It was built with the community and for the community, and was launched in a virtual ceremony organized by the National Programme for Coders. The initiative aims to create a new generation of coders capable of addressing future challenges and opportunities in the knowledge-based economy, and providing an incubating environment for skilled coders to innovate technical solutions to current societal challenges.

The platform features advanced technological infrastructure, including an events space, a supercomputer, and workspaces, with plans to open six additional locations throughout the UAE. It also focuses on assessing and developing the skills of coders in the UAE, enabling continuous communication among coders in the UAE and around the world, and providing coders with the best opportunities to help them ideate, create and innovate.

To support the growth of the UAE's digital economy, training programs for Emiratis will be organized to facilitate their participation in various coding fields. These programs will provide them with the best global knowledge to hone their skills. The program will be collaborating with a wide range of organizations from government, semi-government, private and academic sectors to achieve the goal of promoting coding. These partners include Abu Dhabi University, Majid Al Futtaim Holding, Microsoft Middle East and Africa, IBM, Presales MERAT, Meta, Rabdan Academy, the American University in Dubai, DP World, ADNOC, VMware, and more.</p>
