<h2>:wave: Introduction</h2>
<p>CodersHQ was built to enable and support :muscle: coders :technologist:, who work as strategic enablers to the UAE digital economy :united_arab_emirates::coin:. The CodersHQ platform was built with passion :yellow_heart:; by the community and for the community :busts_in_silhouette:, to provide coders with the means to be part of something bigger, and to contribute to the local coding community and coding communities all over the world :earth_asia:.</p>

<h2>:technologist: CodersHQ</h2>
<p>CodersHQ manifests itself in :two: ways: <b>CodersHQ Space :house:</b> and <b>CodersHQ Platform/Community :speech_balloon:</b>.</p>

<h3>:house: CodersHQ Space</h3>
<p>The CodersHQ Space is divided into :seven: sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><ins>Main Hall</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Python Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>JavaScript Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>C Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Kitchen</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Solidity Room</ins></li>
  <li><ins>Supercomputer Room</ins></li>
</ul>

<p>:classical_building: The Main Hall is where we host conferences and meetups :busts_in_silhouette: at CodersHQ. A Huawei Smartboard and a Podium are available to speakers :microphone: to enhance their presenting abilities and enable Hybrid Events (wow, much tech :iphone::computer::desktop_computer:!).</p>

<p>:snake: The Python Room is where coders come together to ideate, create and innovate. It contains a conference table with space for :six: people, and a gorgeous window wall :window: (that makes you feel like a fish in a bowl :fish:).</p>

<p>:scroll: The JavaScript Room houses an array of state of the art Desktop Computers :desktop_computer:, capable of computing the heaviest of loads at lightning speeds :zap: (Cyberpunk 2077!? :astonished:)</p>

<p>:: The C Room, much like it's current state in the industry :factory:, is an empty room with tables and chairs :chair: (you should be glad we decided to include it in the first place :wink:)</p>

<p>:fork_and_knife: The Kitchen is a place to recharge :battery: with fellow coders and a bite to eat :knife::spoon:. Sadly, we don't have an Electric Kettle yet (as the formula says, recharge = rest + <del>fuel</del> fury :anger:)</p>

<p>:eyeglasses: The Solidity Room is a storage room and server room combined. It's where all the nerds :nerd_face: (<b>cough</b> Rash- <b>cough</b>) hangout.</p>

<p>:muscle::desktop_computer: The Supercomputer Room is pretty self explanatory; a room with a supercomputer. This computer is able to perform every kind of workload you can imagine (too bad you don't have access to it :smiling_imp:).</p>

<h3>:speech_balloon: CodersHQ Platform/Community</h3>
<p>The CodersHQ Platform/Community has a lot of initiatives going on at once, and it's often hard to keep track :railway_track: of everything that's going on. Every initiative at CodersHQ falls under :one::zero: major categories, and this section serves as a map :world_map: of everything that's currently going on at CodersHQ that you (yes, your beautiful face :smiley: !) can participate in:</p>

<p>:brain: hq(get inspired) is an initiative that attracts the biggest global :globe_with_meridians: tech influencers :technologist: to the local coding community, with the prime objective of igniting a passion :fire: in people for coding by learning from the challenges and personal life stories of prominent people in tech.</p>

<p>:writing_hand: hq(assessment) is an initiative that focuses on assessing coders technical skills :hammer::wrench: in the UAE :united_arab_emirates:, with the goal of connecting them to some of the best opportunities in the market :office:.</p>

<p>:office_worker: hq(ambassador) is an initiative that recruits coders from the local coding community to :speech_balloon: "spread the coding message" by way of hosting events, building projects, networking and growing :seedling: the community.</p>

<p>:loudspeaker: hq(conferences) is an initiative that takes hq(meetups) and bumps it up to a whole new level :arrow_up::chart_with_upwards_trend: by getting a lot more people involved from a lot more diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p>

<p>:bulb: hq(learn) is an initiative that teaches :teacher: coders the technical skills needed to become successful :money_with_wings: in their career, by learning locally, thinking constructively and implementing globally.</p>

<p>:busts_in_silhouette: hq(meetups) is an initiative that helps you meet like-minded people :people_holding_hands: in the coding disciplines you're interested in, and learn from the more experienced :nerd_face: of those around you.</p>

<p>:space_invader: hq(hackathons) is an initiative that tests your skills as a coder and problem solver, while racing against the clock :timer_clock:. Win, and receive a bunch of cool prizes in return :sunglasses:.</p>

<p>:checkered_flag: hq(challenges) is an initiative that gives you the chance to prove :receipt: your worth as a coder by helping some of the biggest companies in the MENA region solve technical challenges :gear:.</p>

<p>:briefcase: hq(internship) is an initiative that helps bridge the gap between being a student :student: to becoming a working professional :office_worker: by learning from some of the best companies in the MENA region.</p>

<p>:jigsaw: hq(021) is an initiative that gives you the chance to use your coding skills to change the world :world_map: for the better by coming up with new, innovative solutions :heavy_check_mark: to help tackle various global issues.</p>
